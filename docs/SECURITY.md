# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability
Please do NOT open a public issue for security-sensitive bugs.

Instead, email the maintainer or use GitHub private vulnerability reporting (if enabled).

## Principles in this repo
- Tools are gated by allowlists built from live `tools/list`
- Tool outputs are typed (Pydantic) via `structuredContent`
- Summaries must be grounded with evidence quotes
